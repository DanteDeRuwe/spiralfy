        <p>Spiralfy is a way to switch up your Spotify experience!</p>
        <p>
          Spiralfy picks one playlist at random, shuffle playing its songs, and whenever you feel like you want a
          different vibe, you let Spiralfy pick a new playlist to listen to.

          Unfortunately, you will need a <b>Spotify Premium account</b> to use Spiralfy. If you have one, great! Log in
